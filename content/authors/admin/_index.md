I am a first-year Phd student in RAAD Lab at Purdue University Mechanical Engineering Department. My main research interests are soft-growing robots, miniature robots, and reconfigurable robots. I have research experience in these robots' control, design, and manufacturing over the last three years and have a few journal and conference publications about them. Other than research, I love reading, biking, and cooking. Lastly, I am trying to survive in a small town called West Lafayette.
